# Memory_Manager
Extends ESP-32's code memory capacity by dynamically loading functions from long term storage into instruction RAM.


The PlatformIO VSCode extension makes VSCode a highquality environment for embedded development of the ESP-32. If you're a hobbyist looking to move away from the arduino IDE (Which you should. Immediately.) it's a great place to go. This project includes scripts that run when the PLatformIO build system is triggered to integrate the new memory management system into the development process as seamlessly as possible.

Work should be finished (or in a workable place) around May 2022.
