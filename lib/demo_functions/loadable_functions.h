/*
 * This file contains argument structs for loadable functions processing both
 * files and various types of data stored in arrays. Each type of function
 * takes a specific struct designed to represent the arguments needed to control
 * any function working on either buffers or files.
 * The first arguments tell the functions which files or buffers to process
 * and the last argument is a pointer to a costom struct that can contain any
 * user defined arguments needed. That makes the range of functions that can be
 * controlled by functions of this types extremely flexible. At the bottom
 * of the file there are typedefs for function pointers of all of these types
 * and one for a function that returns int and takes no arguments, which is what is used
 * in the basic testing functions.
