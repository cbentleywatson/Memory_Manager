Purpose:
	The memory Manager is designed to provide all the functions needed to manipulate memory in a way that doesn't cause operating system errors due to load_store and misaligned systems
	It's designed to prevent strange compilation options being needed in the main system. 
	All code needs to follow the tighest requirements for clean c++ code because the memory functions are very likely to cause errors. 

To Do:
Rename func to void ptr to be more descripttive
Deal with the functions not class based in the file_to_heap
