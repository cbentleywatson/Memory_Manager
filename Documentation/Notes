It seems like fpic runs fine

Compile a shared library:
gcc -shared -o libhello.so -fPIC hello.c

Default Compiler Flags:
These are stored in idedate.json at the very bottom of the file.

Contents of lib_memory_Manager.ar
Even with a shared object file, ar can effectively store a shared object

This is where my pointer to pointer code came from:

IDK how the code works.

Dead code strip without LTO:

-Wl,-static -fvtable-gc -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-s
DEFAULT FLAGS:


 "-fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -std=gnu++11 -fpic -fpermissive -Os -Wall -nostdlib -Wpointer-arith -Wno-error=unused-but-set-variable -Wno-error=unused-variable -mlongcalls -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fstrict-volatile-bitfields -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations -Wno-error=unused-function -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-sign-compare -fstack-protector -fexceptions -Werror=reorder"}

DEADCODESTRIP := -Wl,-static -fvtable-gc -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-s

 -Wl,-static
Link against static libraries.  Required for dead-code elimination.

-fvtable-gc
C++ virtual method table instrumented with garbage collection information for the linker.

-fdata-sections
Keeps data in separate data sections, so they can be discarded if unused.

-ffunction-sections
Keeps funcitons in separate data sections, so they can be discarded if unused.

-Wl,--gc-sections
Tell the linker to garbage collect and discard unused sections.

-s
Strip the debug information, so as to make the code as small as possible.  (I presume that you'd want to do this in a dead-code removal build.)

The requirement to link against the static libraries was surprising to me.  But there you go.

CRUCIAL!!!!!!
You can link a script if you specify the library path first. Or at least you can make this compile

            "-Wl,-C:\Users\cbent\Dropbox",
            "-Wl,-T a.txt"
