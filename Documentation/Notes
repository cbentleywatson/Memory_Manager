C++ virtual method table instrumented with garbage collection information for the linker.

-fdata-sections
Keeps data in separate data sections, so they can be discarded if unused.

-ffunction-sections
Keeps funcitons in separate data sections, so they can be discarded if unused.

-Wl,--gc-sections
Tell the linker to garbage collect and discard unused sections.

-s
Strip the debug information, so as to make the code as small as possible.  (I presume that you'd want to do this in a dead-code removal build.)

The requirement to link against the static libraries was surprising to me.  But there you go.

Esp32 Default linker script:
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/451ce8a/components/esp_system/ld/esp32s2/sections.ld.in

INSTRUCTION ADDRESSING:

Internal execution RAM is located between       0x4008_0000 and    0x400A_0000
However, the executable address space runs from 0x4008_0000 to     0x407F_FFFF.
Note that the "7" is one place over from the "A" in 
That entire area is accessible by the cache and memory management unit.

Information on storing stack data out side of ROM:

CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_STACK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY
Allow external memory as an argument to xTaskCreateStatic

Found in: Component config > ESP32-specific > CONFIG_ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT > SPI RAM config

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/kconfig.html#config-spiram-allow-stack-external-memory


Because some bits of the ESP32 code environment cannot be recompiled with the cache workaround, normally tasks cannot be safely run with their stack residing in external memory; for this reason xTaskCreate (and related task creaton functions) always allocate stack in internal memory and xTaskCreateStatic will check if the memory passed to it is in internal memory. If you have a task that needs a large amount of stack and does not call on ROM code in any way (no direct calls, but also no Bluetooth/WiFi), you can try enable this to cause xTaskCreateStatic to allow tasks stack in external memory.

Default value:
No (disabled) if SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC && CONFIG_ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT

CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE
SPI RAM access method

Found in: Component config > ESP32-specific > CONFIG_ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT > SPI RAM config

The SPI RAM can be accessed in multiple methods: by just having it available as an unmanaged memory region in the CPU’s memory map, by integrating it in the heap as ‘special’ memory needing heap_caps_malloc to allocate, or by fully integrating it making malloc() also able to return SPI RAM pointers.

Available options:
Integrate RAM into memory map (SPIRAM_USE_MEMMAP)

Make RAM allocatable using heap_caps_malloc(…, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM) (SPIRAM_USE_CAPS_ALLOC)

Make RAM allocatable using malloc() as well (SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC)


#### This option has to do with avoiding the issue where using the flash cache blocks access to external ram.

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/kconfig.html#config-spiram-cache-workaround

Put libc’s jump related functions in IRAM

Found in: Component config > ESP32-specific > CONFIG_ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT > SPI RAM config > SPIRAM workaround libraries placement

The functions affected by this option are: longjmp and setjmp. Putting these function in IRAM will allow them to be called when flash cache is disabled but it will also reduce the available size of free IRAM for the user application.

Default value:
Yes (enabled) if CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_WORKAROUND && CONFIG_ESP32_SPIRAM_SUPPORT

FATAL ERRORS:

### Load_Store_Alignment:
32 bit load from 4 byte aligned address only, 16 from two etc. This probably means any load from 


### Load Prohibited or Store Prohibited:

If ExecV is zero a null ptr was probably used. If the address is ouside of 0x3fxx_xxxx and 0x6xxx_xxxx, the value is garbage


### Instr_Fetch_Prohibited:

CPU could not load this instruction because the instruction address is not in a valid region of instruction ram or ROM. Usually this is caused by attempting to call a function pointer which does not point to valid code. Program counter register register can usually be used as an indicator. It will either be zero ( from a null ptr or around zero due to a null ptr used with an offset addition), or a garbage value (not 0x4xxx_xxxx).

Arduino Based library:
https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory/blob/master/README.md

### Mapping External Flash to Address Space:

#include "esp_spi_flash.h"

  #Current Code (Located in Main):
      size_t src_address;
    size_t size;
    spi_flash_mmap_memory_t memory_type;
    const void **out_ptr; // points to the mapped memory region
    spi_flash_mmap_handle_t handle;
    // spi_flash_mmap(src_address, size, SPI_FLASH_MMAP_DATA, out_ptr, handle);
### C++ syntax for fp conversions:

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast
See item #7's note on function pointer  conversions

    ### Good Example Code:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1096341/function-pointers-casting-in-c/1096349

### Casting Pointers to Numeric Values:

There's a data type defined to do this, uint_ptr.
It's special property is that if you turn a ptr into this type then convert it back it 
will always have the same value afterwards. This is portable. 

### Function Pointer Dtructs:

Fuse includes structs made solely of function pointers, with the struct holding 
the type of each function ptr; type def each relevant function and store it in one of these.

### Failure to send exec code to FLASH:
 Turns out the mmap function is one way only. You can't write to a mapped address, you can only read.

###  Calling Assembly functions:

The calls are always 132_r to a spot 4 bytes above the start of the address; the stuff in parens evaluates to a constant to it's lefr

### Setting Entry Symbols:

ENTRY(symbol)  added to the beginning of the script sets the header entry location to equal the symbol. The value put in the header in the offset of that symbol relative to the start of 
the text header.

### Locating the addresses of functions via functions and relative loads:

Its possible to create a function that returns it's own address regardless of it's current location in memory using relative loads and the program counter.

#### KEY: Function Loading to struct:
	Using the L32r relative location system above, it's possible to calculate the correct address of any function if you can call it. You can fill a table of function locations by calling a
	single function thats in the same text segment. Filling in the locations means you can call the subfunctions using the function table returned.

#### KEY: Adding Custom Header Info:
Adding a series of bytes to the .txt section so they can be found by referenceing offsets from entry.

### Linker Script Info:

    And that set the VMA to 1000
### Setting NOLOAD Option:

.text  : {

    This removes the relocation entries for the text section

    It  Also removes the "LOAD" flag from teh corresponding section header

### Relocation Options:
    Removed -r after the LMA and VMA stuff was assigned.
    It simply removed the relocation tables, added the program header which also moved the start of the sections farther down, so the text section no longer started at file offset 34

            --set-section-flags sectionpattern=flags
           Set the flags for any sections matching sectionpattern.  The
           flags argument is a comma separated string of flag names.
           The recognized names are alloc, contents, load, noload,
           readonly, code, data, rom, exclude, share, and debug.  You
           can set the contents flag for a section which does not have
           contents, but it is not meaningful to clear the contents flag
           of a section which does have contents--just remove the
           section instead.  Not all flags are meaningful for all object
           file formats.  In particular the share flag is only
           meaningful for COFF format files and not for ELF format
           files.

#### MEMORY:
